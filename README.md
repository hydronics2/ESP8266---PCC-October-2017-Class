# ESP8266---PCC-October-2017-Class

We'll be programming the ESP8266 wifi chip on a NodeMCU development board.
The NodeMCU board here: http://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html
Your boards are pre-programmed as wifi hot spots. Try connecting to your board with your phone and trying these pages:http://192.168.4.1/index.html this controls the blue onboard LED

Iâ€™ve distributed portable copies of the Arduino IDE version 1.8.5 with the ESP8266 and relevant libraries included.
If you need to re-create these files, you may follow the directions by sparkfun to add the json board files from the Arduino Board Manager menu: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-thing-development-board-hookup-guide/setting-up-arduino
